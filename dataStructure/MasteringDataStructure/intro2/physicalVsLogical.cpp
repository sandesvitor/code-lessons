/*
    << PHYSICAL DATA STRUCTURES >>

        - Meant for storing the data in the memory (inserting, deleting values);

    1) Arrays:

    Array are a contiguous memory location (memory location side by side/ 
    differente from a Linked List!).

    Arrays have fixed size (static size). Can be created inside Stack or inside 
    Heap.

    2) Linked Lists:

    Totally dinamic size (size can be changed). Collection of Nodes are always
    created in the Heap (Head Node are in the Stack);


    Both Array and Linked List are physical because the are related to the location
    of the memory.


    << LOGICAL DATA STRUCTURES >>

        - Meant for manipullating those values stored in the memory;
        - Will be implemented using physical data structures (array and/or linked
            lists).

    1) Stack (linear);
    2) Queues (linear);
    3) Trees (non-linear);
    4) Graph (non-linear);
    5) Hash Table (tabular);
