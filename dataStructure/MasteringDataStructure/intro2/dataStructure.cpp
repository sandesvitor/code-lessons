/*
    DATA STRUCTURE: Is an arrangement and operation of data!
    (without it, it can't be any application)

    Data programs will be inside de the Main Memory (RAM).


                                                                # # #

    Every application have to deal with some data inside of RAM!

    TYPES OF DATA:

    1) DATA STRUCTURES are form in the Main Memory(RAM) during the execution time 
    of the application (Runtime);

    2) DATA BASE (large size data) is arrangement of data in the permanent storage 
    (SQL, NoSQL,...);

    3) DATA WAREHOUSE is commercial data stored in array of disks, etc (Data Mining
    alghoritms are used to analize this type of data);

    4) BIG DATA are HUGE size data accumulated on the internet.
